        <p> Matt O'Leary is a veteran of the insurance industry. He has a passion for finding clients the right health
          coverage by building customized plans, because one-size never really fits all. As a father, Matt takes great
          pride in helping families. He understands the importance of protecting your loved ones and that families
          shouldn't have to sacrifice health coverage because of rising health care costs. Matt also specializes in
          working with self-employed individuals. The freedom that comes from being self-employed also comes with
          challenges. Matt can cut through all of the jargon and make finding coverage simple.</p>
        <p>
          Are you a small business owner looking to extend coverage to your employees? Matt also specializes in
          comprehensive benefit packages for groups of 20 or less. Just by providing a basic healthcare package, small
